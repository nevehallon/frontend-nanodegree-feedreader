# Javascript-testing

## About This Project
This project is based on the concept of test-driven JavaScript programming. Here, I have used the starter code given by Udacity and the
jasmine testing framework to create a series of test suites for the efficiency of my application.

## Getting Started
* To load the feed reader app with the jasmine specsheet simply clone this repository or create a pull request. Get more information about pull requests [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
* If you aren't comfortable with either of these, another option would be to simply download the zip file.
* Download or fork the application from [here.](https://github.com/nevehallon/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git)
* Select and open the index.html file to start the application.

## Requirement
The specsheet has been tested only on Chrome, so it is recommended that you use it for further testing and review.

## Diving in Deep
* If you want to write further tests you may do so, in the feedreader.js file in the spec subfolder of the jasmine folder I have written some basic tests which address the basic functionality of the application, so if you want to test more, you'll have to add more features.
To write more tests you can refer to the jasmine framework documentation [here](https://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction)
* The functionality of this app is implemented in app.js so you can use it to give it some more functionality.
